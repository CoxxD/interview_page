### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:

1. **Object literal syntax:**

  The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

  \`\`\`javascript
  var object = {
       name: "Sudheer",
       age: 34
  };
  \`\`\`

  Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.

  **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object.

2. **Object constructor:**

  The simplest way to create an empty object is using the \`Object\` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

  \`\`\`javascript
  var object = new Object();
  \`\`\`

  The \`Object()\` is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required. The above code snippet can be re-written as:

  \`\`\`javascript
  var object = Object();
  \`\`\`

3. **Object's create method:**

  The \`create\` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects.
  The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.

  The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.

  \`\`\`javascript
  var object = Object.create(null);
  \`\`\`
  The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.

  \`\`\`javascript
  let vehicle = {
    wheels: '4',
    fuelType: 'Gasoline',
    color: 'Green'
  }
  let carProps = {
    type: {
      value: 'Volkswagen'
    },
    model: {
      value: 'Golf'
    }
  }

  var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);
  console.log(car);
  \`\`\`

4. **Function constructor:**

  In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances.

  \`\`\`javascript
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = 21;
  }
  var object = new Person("Sudheer");
  \`\`\`

5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

  This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

  \`\`\`javascript
  function Person() {}
  Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
  var object = new Person();
  \`\`\`

  This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

  \`\`\`javascript
  function func() {}

  new func(x, y, z);
  \`\`\`

  **(OR)**

  \`\`\`javascript
  // Create a new instance using function prototype.
  var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

  // Call the function
  var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

  // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
  console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
  \`\`\`
6. **Object's assign method:**

  The \`Object.assign\` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object.

  The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.

  \`\`\`javascript
  const orgObject = { company: 'XYZ Corp'};
  const carObject = { name: 'Toyota'};
  const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);
  \`\`\`

7. **ES6 Class syntax:**

  ES6 introduces class feature to create objects.

  \`\`\`javascript
  class Person {
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }

  var object = new Person("Sudheer");
  \`\`\`

8. **Singleton pattern:**

  A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

  \`\`\`javascript
  var object = new (function () {
    this.name = "Sudheer";
  })();
  \`\`\`

### What is a prototype chain

**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types 
of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to 
inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you 
create an object using a constructor function or a 
class, the created object inherits properties from 
a prototype object.

The prototype on object instance is available through 
**Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **\_\_proto\_\_** 
property whereas prototype on constructor function 
is available through **Object.prototype**.

### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be 
explained with below examples,

**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given 
\`this\` value and arguments provided one by one

\`\`\`javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
 console.log(
   greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
 );
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
\`\`\`

**Apply:** Invokes the function with a given \`this\` 
value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

\`\`\`javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
 console.log(
   greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
 );
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
\`\`\`

**Bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to 
pass any number of arguments

\`\`\`javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
 console.log(
   greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
 );
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
\`\`\`

Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both 
execute the current function immediately. You need to 
decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a 
comma separated list of arguments. You can remember 
by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) 
and Apply is for **Array**.

Bind creates a new function that will have \`this\` set 
to the first parameter passed to bind().

### What is JSON and its common operations

**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript 
object syntax, which was popularized by \`Douglas Crockford\`. 
It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network. 
It is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, 
and a MIME type of application/json

### What is the purpose of the array slice method

The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in 
an array as a new array object. It selects the elements 
starting at the given start argument, and ends at the 
given optional end argument without including the last 
element. If you omit the second argument then it selects 
till the end of the array. This method can also accept 
negative index which counts back from the end of the array.

### What is the purpose of the array splice method

The **splice()** method adds/removes items to/from an array, 
and then returns the removed item. The first argument 
specifies the array position/index for insertion or 
deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates 
the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional 
argument is added to the array.

Some of the examples of this method are:

\`\`\`javascript
let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
\`\`\`

**Note:** Splice method modifies the original array 
and returns the deleted array.

### What is the difference between slice and splice

Some of the major differences in a tabular form:

| Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
| Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
| Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert/delete elements to/from array |

### How do you compare Object and Map

**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let 
you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete 
keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. 
Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps 
historically. But there are important differences that 
make using a Map preferable in certain cases:

1. The keys of an Object can be Strings and Symbols, 
whereas they can be any value for a Map, including 
functions, objects, and any primitive type.
2. The keys in a Map are ordered while keys added 
to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, 
a Map object returns keys in the order of insertion.
3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size 
property, while the number of properties in an Object 
must be determined manually.
4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, 
whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its 
keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys 
in an object that could collide with your keys if you're 
not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by creating 
an object(which can be called a map) using \`Object.create(null)\`, 
but this practice is seldom done.
6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent 
addition and removal of key pairs.

### What is the difference between == and === operators

JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and 
type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. 
The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, 
while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion 
based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow 
the below conditions for different types,

1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the 
same sequence of characters, same length, and same 
characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are 
numerically equal, i.e., having the same number value.
  There are two special cases in this,
  1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
  2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both 
are true or both are false.
4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to 
the same Object.
5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, 
but equal with == .
  i.e, \`null===undefined --> false\`, but \`null==undefined --> true\`

Some of the example which covers the above cases:

\`\`\`javascript
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
NaN == NaN or NaN === NaN // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
\`\`\`

### What are lambda expressions or arrow functions

An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for 
a function expression and does not have its own **this, 
arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are 
best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot 
be used as constructors.

Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,
\`\`\`javascript
const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters
const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10; // Single parameter
const arrowFunc3 = () => {} // no parameters
\`\`\`

### What is a first class function

In Javascript, functions are first class objects. 
First-class functions means when functions in 
that language are treated like any other variable.

For example, in such a language, a function can 
be passed as an argument to other functions, can 
be returned by another function and can be assigned 
as a value to a variable. For example, in the below 
example, handler functions assigned to a listener

\`\`\`javascript
const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
document.addEventListener("click", handler);
\`\`\`

### What is a first order function

A first-order function is a function that doesn’t 
accept another function as an argument and doesn’t 
return a function as its return value.

\`\`\`javascript
const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
\`\`\`

### What is a higher order function

A higher-order function is a function that accepts 
another function as an argument or returns a 
function as a return value or both.
The syntactic structure of higher order function 
will be as follows,

\`\`\`javascript
const firstOrderFunc = () =>
  console.log("Hello, I am a First order function");
const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
\`\`\`
You can also call the function which you are 
passing to higher order function as callback function.

The higher order function is helpful to write 
the modular and reusable code. 

### What is a unary function

A unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that 
accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a 
single argument accepted by a function.

Let us take an example of unary function,

\`\`\`javascript
const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
\`\`\`

### What is the currying function

Currying is the process of taking a function with 
multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence 
of functions each with only a single argument. 
Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. 
By applying currying, an n-ary function turns into a 
unary function.

Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it 
turns into a currying function,

\`\`\`javascript
const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
\`\`\`

Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** 
and **functional composition**.

### What is a pure function

A **Pure function** is a function where the return 
value is only determined by its arguments without 
any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with 
the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number 
of places in the application then it will always 
return the same value.

Let's take an example to see the difference between 
pure and impure functions,

\`\`\`javascript
//Impure
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
//Pure
const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
  argNumberArray.concat([number]);

//Display the results
console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
\`\`\`

As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function 
is impure itself by altering the array and returning 
a push number index independent of the parameter value, 
whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and 
concatenates it with the other array producing a whole 
new array without side effects. Also, the return value 
is a concatenation of the previous array.

Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify 
unit testing without any side effects and no need for 
dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling 
and make it harder to break your application by not 
having any side effects. These principles are coming 
together with the **Immutability** concept of ES6: 
giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

### What is the purpose of the let keyword

The \`let\` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. 
Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in 
scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it 
is used. Whereas variables declared with the \`var\` keyword 
used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire 
function regardless of block scope.

Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

\`\`\`javascript
let counter = 30;
if (counter === 30) {
  let counter = 31;
  console.log(counter); // 31
}
console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between let and var

You can list out the differences in a tabular format

| var                                                   | let                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| It has been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
| It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
| Variable declaration will be hoisted, initialized as undefined  | Hoisted but not initialized |
| It is possible to re-declare the variable in the same scope | It is not possible to re-declare the variable |

Let's take an example to see the difference,

\`\`\`javascript
function userDetails(username) {
  if (username) {
    console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
    console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
    let age = 30;
    var salary = 10000;
  }
  console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible due to function scope)
  console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails("John");
\`\`\`

### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

\`let\` is a mathematical statement that was adopted by 
early programming languages like **Scheme** and **Basic**. 
It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use 
\`let\` already as a traditional keyword as close to \`var\` as possible.

### How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error

If you try to redeclare variables in a \`switch block\` then 
it will cause errors because there is only one block. 
For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

\`\`\`javascript
let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    let name;
    break;

  case 1:
    let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}
\`\`\`

To avoid this error, you can create a nested block 
inside a case clause and create a new block scoped 
lexical environment.

\`\`\`javascript
let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let name;
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
  }
}
\`\`\`

### What is the Temporal Dead Zone

The Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) is a specific period or 
area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until 
it has been initialized with a value. This behavior in 
JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with 
the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, 
accessing a \`let\` or \`const\` variable before its declaration 
(within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. 

Let's see this behavior with an example,

\`\`\`javascript
function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}
\`\`\`

### What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript 
function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature 
of it would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
(function () {
  // logic here
})();
\`\`\`

The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy 
because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be 
accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access 
variables from the IIFE then it throws an error as below,

\`\`\`javascript
(function () {
  var message = "IIFE";
  console.log(message);
})();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
\`\`\`

### How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?

\`encodeURI()\` function is used to encode an URL. This 
function requires a URL string as a parameter and 
return that encoded string.
\`decodeURI()\` function is used to decode an URL. 
This function requires an encoded URL string as 
parameter and return that decoded string.

**Note:** If you want to encode characters such 
as \`/ ? : @ & = + $ #\` then you need to 
use \`encodeURIComponent()\`.

\`\`\`javascript
let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);
\`\`\`

### What is memoization

Memoization is a functional programming technique which 
attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching 
its previously computed results. Each time a memoized 
function is called, its parameters are used to index the 
cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, 
without executing the entire function. Otherwise the 
function is executed and then the result is added to 
the cache.
Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

\`\`\`javascript
const memoizAddition = () => {
  let cache = {};
  return (value) => {
    if (value in cache) {
      console.log("Fetching from cache");
      return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
    } else {
      console.log("Calculating result");
      let result = value + 20;
      cache[value] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
};
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
\`\`\`

### What is Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, 
function declarations and classes are moved to the 
top of their scope before code execution. Remember 
that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
\`\`\`

The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

\`\`\`javascript
var message;
console.log(message);
message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
\`\`\`

In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

\`\`\`javascript
message("Good morning"); //Good morning

function message(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
\`\`\`

This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in 
code before they are declared.

### What are classes in ES6

In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic 
sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based 
inheritance.
For example, the prototype based inheritance written 
in function expression as below,

\`\`\`javascript
function Bike(model, color) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
  return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
};
\`\`\`

Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

\`\`\`javascript
class Bike {
  constructor(color, model) {
    this.color = color;
    this.model = model;
  }

  getDetails() {
    return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
  }
}
\`\`\`

### What are closures

A closure is the combination of a function 
bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical 
environment within which that function was declared. 
i.e, It is an inner function that has access to 
the outer or enclosing function’s variables, 
functions and other data even after the outer 
function has finished its execution. The closure 
has three scope chains.

1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
2. Outer function's variables
3. Global variables

Let's take an example of closure concept,

\`\`\`javascript
function Welcome(name) {
  var greetingInfo = function (message) {
    console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr. John
\`\`\`

As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) 
has access to the variables in the outer function 
scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

### What are modules

Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code 
and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design 
patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object 
literal, a function, or a constructor

### Why do you need modules

Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

1. Maintainability
2. Reusability
3. Namespacing

### What is scope in javascript

Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and 
objects in some particular part of your code during 
runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility 
of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

### What is a service worker

A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) 
that runs in the background, separate from a web page 
and provides features that don't need a web page or 
user interaction. Some of the major features of service 
workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web 
application development), periodic background syncs, 
push notifications, intercept and handle network requests 
and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

### How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it 
can communicate with the pages it controls by responding 
to messages sent via the \`postMessage\` interface, 
and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

### How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated 
when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, 
so you cannot rely on global state within a service 
worker's \`onfetch\` and \`onmessage\` handlers. In this 
case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB 
API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

### What is IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of 
larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. 
This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches 
of this data.

### What is web storage

Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which 
browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the 
user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than 
using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms 
for storing data on the client.

1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin 
with no expiration date.
2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session 
and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

### What is a post message

Post message is a method that enables cross-origin 
communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a 
page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page 
and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts 
on different pages are allowed to access each other 
if and only if the pages follow same-origin 
policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port 
number, and host).

### What is a Cookie

A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your 
computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies 
are saved as key/value pairs.
For example, you can create a cookie named username 
as below,

\`\`\`javascript
document.cookie = "username=John";
\`\`\`

### Why do you need a Cookie

Cookies are used to remember information about 
the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile 
can be stored in a cookie.
2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie 
remembers the user profile.

### What are the options in a cookie

There are few below options available for a cookie,

1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the 
browser is closed but you can change this behavior 
by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

\`\`\`javascript
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
\`\`\`

1. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. 
But you can tell the browser what path the cookie 
belongs to using a path parameter.

\`\`\`javascript
document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
\`\`\`

### How do you delete a cookie

You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date 
as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie 
value in this case.
For example, you can delete a username cookie in the 
current page as below.

\`\`\`javascript
document.cookie =
  "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
\`\`\`

**Note:** You should define the cookie path option 
to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some 
browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless 
you specify a path parameter.

### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

Below are some of the differences between cookie, 
local storage and session storage,

| Feature                           | Cookie                             | Local storage    | Session storage     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side. The \`set-cookie\` HTTP response header is used by server inorder to send it to user.     | client-side only | client-side only    |
| Expiry                          | Manually configured using Expires option | Forever until deleted    | until tab is closed |
| SSL support                       | Supported                          | Not supported    | Not supported       |
| Maximum data size                 | 4KB                                | 5 MB             | 5MB                 |
| Accessible from                            | Any window | Any window | Same tab |
| Sent with requests | Yes | No | No |

### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage

LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it 
persists the data even when the browser is closed 
and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas 
in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page 
session ends.

### How do you access web storage

The Window object implements the \`WindowLocalStorage\` 
and \`WindowSessionStorage\` objects which has 
\`localStorage\`(window.localStorage) and 
\`sessionStorage\`(window.sessionStorage) 
properties respectively. These properties 
create an instance of the Storage object, 
through which data items can be set, 
retrieved and removed for a specific domain 
and storage type (session or local).
For example, you can read and write on local 
storage objects as below

\`\`\`javascript
localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
localStorage.getItem("logo");
\`\`\`

### What are the methods available on session storage

The session storage provided methods for reading, 
writing and clearing the session data

\`\`\`javascript
// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();
\`\`\`

### What is a storage event and its event handler

The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage 
area has been changed in the context of another document. 
Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for 
processing storage events.
The syntax would be as below

\`\`\`javascript
window.onstorage = functionRef;
\`\`\`

Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler 
which logs the storage key and it's values

\`\`\`javascript
window.onstorage = function (e) {
  console.log(
    "The " +
      e.key +
      " key has been changed from " +
      e.oldValue +
      " to " +
      e.newValue +
      "."
  );
};
\`\`\`

### Why do you need web storage

Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data 
can be stored locally, without affecting website 
performance. Also, the information is never transferred 
to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach 
than Cookies.

### How do you check web storage browser support

You need to check browser support for localStorage 
and sessionStorage before using web storage,

\`\`\`javascript
if (typeof Storage !== "undefined") {
  // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
}
\`\`\`
### How do you check web workers browser support

You need to check browser support for web workers before using it

\`\`\`javascript
if (typeof Worker !== "undefined") {
  // code for Web worker support.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
}
\`\`\`

### Give an example of a web worker

You need to follow below steps to start using web 
workers for counting example

1. Create a Web Worker File: You need to write a script 
to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js

\`\`\`javascript
let i = 0;

function timedCount() {
  i = i + 1;
  postMessage(i);
  setTimeout("timedCount()", 500);
}

timedCount();
\`\`\`

Here postMessage() method is used to post a 
message back to the HTML page

1. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker 
object by checking for browser support. Let's name this 
file as web_worker_example.js

\`\`\`javascript
if (typeof w == "undefined") {
  w = new Worker("counter.js");
}
\`\`\`

and we can receive messages from web worker

\`\`\`javascript
w.onmessage = function (event) {
  document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
};
\`\`\`

1. Terminate a Web Worker:
   Web workers will continue to listen for messages 
(even after the external script is finished) until it is 
terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate 
listening to the messages.

\`\`\`javascript
w.terminate();
\`\`\`

1. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable 
to undefined you can reuse the code

\`\`\`javascript
w = undefined;
\`\`\`

### What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM

WebWorkers don't have access to below javascript 
objects since they are defined in an external files

1. Window object
2. Document object
3. Parent object

### What is a promise

A promise is an object that may produce a single value 
some time in the future with either a resolved value or 
a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). 
It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, 
rejected, or pending.

The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

\`\`\`javascript
const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // promise description
});
\`\`\`

The usage of a promise would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("I'm a Promise!");
    }, 5000);
  },
  (reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
\`\`\`

### Why do you need a promise

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. 
They provide an alternative approach for callbacks 
by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

### What are the three states of promise

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise 
before an operation begins
2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified 
operation was completed.
3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation 
did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

### What is a callback function

A callback function is a function passed into another 
function as an argument. This function is invoked inside 
the outer function to complete an action.
Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

\`\`\`javascript
function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
\`\`\`

### Why do we need callbacks

The callbacks are needed because javascript is an 
event driven language. That means instead of waiting 
for a response javascript will keep executing while 
listening for other events.
Let's take an example with the first function invoking 
an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function 
which logs the message.

\`\`\`javascript
function firstFunction() {
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("First function called");
  }, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
  console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output;
// Second function called
// First function called
\`\`\`

As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait 
for the response of the first function and the remaining 
code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way 
to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the 
other code finishes execution.

### What is a callback hell

Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested 
callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug 
when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback 
hell looks like below,

\`\`\`javascript
async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});
\`\`\`

### What are server-sent events

Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology 
enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from 
a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. 
These are a one way communications channel - events flow 
from server to client only. This has been used in 
Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

### How do you receive server-sent event notifications

The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent 
event notifications. For example, you can receive 
messages from server as below,

\`\`\`javascript
if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
  var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
  source.onmessage = function (event) {
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
  };
}
\`\`\`

### What are the main rules of promise

A promise must follow a specific set of rules:

1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant \`.then()\` method
2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

### What is callback in callback

You can nest one callback inside in another callback to 
execute the actions sequentially one by one. 
This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

\`\`\`javascript
loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
  console.log("first script is loaded");

  loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
    console.log("second script is loaded");

    loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
      console.log("third script is loaded");
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });
  });
});
\`\`\`

### What is promise chaining

The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous 
tasks one after another using promises is known as 
Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise 
chaining for calculating the final result,

\`\`\`javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
})
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // 1
    return result * 2;
  })
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // 2
    return result * 3;
  })
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // 6
    return result * 4;
  });
\`\`\`

In the above handlers, the result is passed to the 
chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
2. After that \`.then\` handler is called by logging the 
result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \* 2.
3. After that the value passed to the next \`.then\` 
handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise 
with result \* 3.
4. Finally the value passed to the last \`.then\` handler by 
logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

### What is promise.all

Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of 
promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets 
resolved when all the promises get resolved or 
any one of them gets rejected. For example, 
the syntax of promise.all method is below,

\`\`\`javascript
Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(\`Error in promises\`))
\`\`\`

**Note:** Remember that the order of the 
promises(output the result) is maintained as 
per input order.

### What is the purpose of the race method in promise

Promise.race() method will return the promise 
instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. 
Let's take an example of race() method where 
promise2 is resolved first

\`\`\`javascript
var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
  console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});
\`\`\`

### What is a strict mode in javascript

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows 
you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” 
operating context. This way it prevents certain actions 
from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal 
expression \`use strict;\` instructs the browser to use 
the javascript code in the Strict mode.

### Why do you need strict mode

Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript 
by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, 
it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by 
throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment 
to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a 
non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a 
non-existing object.

### How do you declare strict mode

The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to 
the beginning of a script or a function.
If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global 
scope.

\`\`\`javascript
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
\`\`\`

and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

\`\`\`javascript
x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
}
\`\`\`

### What is the purpose of double exclamation

The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting 
type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), 
it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.
For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

\`\`\`javascript
let isIE8 = false;
isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
\`\`\`

If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null
\`\`\`

**Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

### What is the purpose of the delete operator

The delete operator is used to delete the property as well as its value.

\`\`\`javascript
var user = { firstName: "John", lastName:"Doe", age: 20 };
delete user.age;

console.log(user); // {firstName: "John", lastName:"Doe"}
\`\`\`

### What is typeof operator

You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find 
the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the 
type of a variable or an expression.

\`\`\`javascript
typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
typeof [1, 2, 3]; // Returns "object" because all arrays are also objects
\`\`\`

### What is undefined property

The undefined property indicates that a variable 
has not been assigned a value, or declared but not 
initialized at all. The type of undefined value is 
undefined too.

\`\`\`javascript
var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof user); //undefined
\`\`\`

Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to 
undefined.

\`\`\`javascript
user = undefined;
\`\`\`

### What is null value

The value null represents the intentional absence of any 
object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. 
The type of null value is object.
You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

\`\`\`javascript
var user = null;
console.log(typeof user); //object
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between null and undefined

Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

| Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
| Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
| The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
| Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
| Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

### What is eval

The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented 
as a string. The string can be a JavaScript expression, 
variable, statement, or sequence of statements.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(eval("1 + 2")); //  3
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between window and document

Below are the main differences between window and document,

| Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
| By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
| It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

### How do you access history in javascript

The window.history object contains the browser's history. 
You can load previous and next URLs in the history using 
back() and next() methods.

\`\`\`javascript
function goBack() {
  window.history.back();
}
function goForward() {
  window.history.forward();
}
\`\`\`

**Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

### What is isNaN

The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a 
value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. 
i.e, This function returns true if the value equates 
to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

\`\`\`javascript
isNaN("Hello"); //true
isNaN("100"); //false
\`\`\`

### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) 
and undefined variables,

| undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
| If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

### What are global variables

Global variables are those that are available throughout 
the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword 
is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it 
then it will become global variable

\`\`\`javascript
msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
\`\`\`

### What are the problems with global variables

The problem with global variables is the conflict of 
variable names of local and global scope. It is also 
difficult to debug and test the code that relies on 
global variables.

### What is NaN property

The NaN property is a global property that represents 
"Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value 
is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in 
a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

\`\`\`javascript
Math.sqrt(-1);
parseInt("Hello");
\`\`\`

### What is the purpose of isFinite function

The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a 
number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if 
the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), 
otherwise it returns true.

\`\`\`javascript
isFinite(Infinity); // false
isFinite(NaN); // false
isFinite(-Infinity); // false

isFinite(100); // true
\`\`\`

### What is an event flow

Event flow is the order in which event is received on 
the web page. When you click an element that is nested 
in various other elements, before your click actually 
reaches its destination, or target element, it must 
trigger the click event for each of its parent elements 
first, starting at the top with the global window object.

There are two ways of event flow

1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

You can submit a form using \`document.forms[0].submit()\`. 
All the form input's information is submitted using 
onsubmit event handler

\`\`\`javascript
function submit() {
  document.forms[0].submit();
}
\`\`\`

### How do you find operating system details

The window.navigator object contains information 
about the visitor's browser OS details. Some of 
the OS properties are available under platform property,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(navigator.platform);
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events

The \`DOMContentLoaded\` event is fired when the initial HTML 
document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting 
for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. 
Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, 
including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

### What is the difference between native, host and user objects

\`Native objects\` are objects that are part of the JavaScript 
language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, 
String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined 
in the ECMAScript spec.
\`Host objects\` are objects provided by the browser or runtime 
environment (Node). 

For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are 
considered as host objects.
\`User objects\` are objects defined in the javascript code. 
For example, User objects created for profile information.

### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks

Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

**Pros:**

1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the 
callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

**Cons:**

1. It makes little complex code
2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties 
are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element 
has 2 attributes type and value,

\`\`\`javascript
<input type="text" value="Name:">
\`\`\`

You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

\`\`\`javascript
const input = document.querySelector("input");
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
\`\`\`

And after you change the value of the text field to 
"Good evening", it becomes like

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
console.log(input.value); // Good evening
\`\`\`

### What is same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript 
from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is 
defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port 
number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a 
malicious script on one page from obtaining access to 
sensitive data on another web page using 
Document Object Model(DOM).

### What is the purpose of void 0

Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. 
This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, 
because it will return the undefined primitive value. 
It is commonly used for HTML documents that use 
href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an \`<a>\` element. i.e, 
when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or 
refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be 
prevented using this expression.
For example, the below link notify the message 
without reloading the page

\`\`\`javascript
<a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">
  Click Me!
</a>
\`\`\`

### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An 
interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, 
interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a 
technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles 
JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

### Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript

No, they are entirely two different programming languages 
and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are 
Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, 
they follow similar syntax for basic features
(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

### Who created javascript

 JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his 
 time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed 
 under the name \`Mocha\`, but later the language was officially 
 called \`LiveScript\` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

### What is the use of preventDefault method

The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, 
meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the 
event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when 
clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when 
clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

\`\`\`javascript
document
 .getElementById("link")
 .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
   event.preventDefault();
 });
\`\`\`

**Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

### What is the use of stopPropagation method

The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from 
bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested 
divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event 
propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)

\`\`\`javascript
<p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
<div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
 <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
</div>

script
function firstFunc(event) {
 alert("DIV 1");
 event.stopPropagation();
}

function secondFunc() {
 alert("DIV 2");
}
script
\`\`\`
### What is BOM

The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the 
browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, 
location and document which are children of the window. The Browser 
Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different 
browsers.

### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language 
specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that 
the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple 
threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can 
make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

### What is an event delegation

Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where 
you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the 
events that happen inside it.

For example, if you wanted to detect field changes inside a 
specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

\`\`\`javascript
var form = document.querySelector("#registration-form");

// Listen for changes to fields inside the form
form.addEventListener(
 "input",
 function (event) {
   // Log the field that was changed
   console.log(event.target);
 },
 false
);
\`\`\`

### What is ECMAScript

ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of 
JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International 
standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. 
The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

### What is JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is 
used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript 
language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

### Why do you need JSON

When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can 
only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to 
and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

### What are PWAs

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app 
delivered through the web, built using common web technologies 
including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to 
servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

### How do you redirect new page in javascript

In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the 
\`location\` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

\`\`\`javascript
function redirect() {
 window.location.href = "newPage.html";
}
\`\`\`

### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains 
a substring or not,

1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided \`String.prototype.includes\` 
method to test a string contains a substring

\`\`\`javascript
var mainString = "hello",
 subString = "hell";
mainString.includes(subString);
\`\`\`

2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use \`String.prototype.indexOf\` which returns the index of a substring. 
If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring 
exists in the main string.

\`\`\`javascript
var mainString = "hello",
 subString = "hell";
mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
\`\`\`

3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's 
test method(\`RegExp.test\`), which allows for testing for against regular 
expressions

\`\`\`javascript
var mainString = "hello",
 regex = /hell/;
regex.test(mainString);
\`\`\`

### How do you get the current url with javascript

You can use \`window.location.href\` expression to get the current 
url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. 
You can also use \`document.URL\` for read-only purposes but this solution 
has issues in FF.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
\`\`\`

### How do get query string values in javascript

You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. 
Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

\`\`\`javascript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const clientCode = urlParams.get("clientCode");
\`\`\`

### How do you check if a key exists in an object

You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

  \`\`\`javascript
  "key" in obj;
  \`\`\`

  and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

  \`\`\`javascript
  !("key" in obj);
  \`\`\`

2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use \`hasOwnProperty\` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

  \`\`\`javascript
  obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
  \`\`\`

3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

  \`\`\`javascript
  const user = {
    name: "John",
  };

  console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
  console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
  \`\`\`

### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

You can use the \`for-in\` loop to loop through javascript object. 
You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property 
of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using 
\`hasOwnProperty\` method.

\`\`\`javascript
var object = {
 k1: "value1",
 k2: "value2",
 k3: "value3",
};

for (var key in object) {
 if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
   console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
 }
}
\`\`\`

### How do you test for an empty object

There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object
2. entries length along with constructor type.

\`\`\`javascript
Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
\`\`\`

2. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys 
length along with constructor type.

\`\`\`javascript
Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
\`\`\`

3. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can 
use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

\`\`\`javascript
function isEmpty(obj) {
 for (var prop in obj) {
   if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
     return false;
   }
 }

 return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
}
\`\`\`

### What is an arguments object

The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside 
functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to 
that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments 
object inside sum function,

\`\`\`javascript
function sum() {
 var total = 0;
 for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
   total += arguments[i];
 }
 return total;
}

sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
\`\`\`

**Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. 
But you can convert into a regular array as below.

\`\`\`javascript
var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
\`\`\`

### What are the pros and cons of for loops

The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. 
It has both pros and cons

#### Pros

1. Works on every environment
2. You can use break and continue flow control statements

#### Cons

3. Too verbose
4. Imperative
5. You might face off-by-one errors.

### How do you display the current date in javascript

You can use \`new Date()\` to generate a new Date object 
containing the current date and time. For example, let's 
display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

\`\`\`javascript
var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
document.write(today);
\`\`\`

### What is an app shell model

An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build 
a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' 
screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful 
for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

### Can we define properties for functions

Yes, We can define properties for functions because functions are 
also objects.

\`\`\`javascript
fn = function (x) {
 //Function code goes here
};

fn.name = "John";

fn.profile = function (y) {
 //Profile code goes here
};
\`\`\`

### What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function

You can use \`function.length\` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of \`sum\` function to calculate the sum of numbers,

\`\`\`javascript
function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
 return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
}
sum.length; // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
\`\`\`

### What is a polyfill

A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on 
older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin 
polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

There are two main polyfill libraries available,
1. **Core.js**: It is a modular javascript library used for cutting-edge 
ECMAScript features.
2. **Polyfill.io:** It provides polyfills that are required for browser 
needs.

### What are break and continue statements

The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the 
loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

\`\`\`javascript
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 if (i === 5) {
   break;
 }
 text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
\`\`\`

The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, 
It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and 
continues with the next iteration in the loop.

\`\`\`javascript
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 if (i === 5) {
   continue;
 }
 text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
\`\`\`

### What are js labels

The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. 
We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. 
For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the 
numbers when they are same,

\`\`\`javascript
var i, j;

loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
 loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
   if (i === j) {
     continue loop1;
   }
   console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
 }
}

// Output is:
//   "i = 1, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 1"
\`\`\`

### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top

It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each 
script or function. The benefits of doing this are,

1. Gives cleaner code
2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

### What are the benefits of initializing variables

It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,

1. It gives cleaner code
2. It provides a single place to initialize variables
3. Avoid undefined values in the code

### How do you generate random integers

You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. 
For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, 
the multiplication factor should be 10,

\`\`\`javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
\`\`\`

**Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), 
and 1 (exclusive)

### Can you write a random integers function to print integers within a range

Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number 
between min and max (both included)

\`\`\`javascript
function randomInteger(min, max) {
 return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}
randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
\`\`\`

### What is tree shaking

Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that 
unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the 
build process and for that it relies on the static structure 
of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially 
this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler \`rollup\`.

### What is the need of tree shaking

Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. 
i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the 
application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” 
Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, 
but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. 
Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

### What is a Regular Expression

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. 
You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be 
used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

### What are the string methods that accept Regular expression

There are six string methods: search(), replace(), replaceAll(), 
match(), matchAll(), and split().

### How do you search a string for a pattern

You can use the test() method of regular expression in order to search 
a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

\`\`\`javascript
var pattern = /you/;
console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
\`\`\`

### How do you change the style of a HTML element

You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using 
javascript

1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using 
style property

\`\`\`javascript
document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
\`\`\`

2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element 
class using className property

\`\`\`javascript
document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
\`\`\`

### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

The output is going to be \`33\`. Since \`1\` and \`2\` are numeric values, 
the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value \`3\`. 
The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition 
of numeric value \`3\` and string type value \`3\` is just going to be 
a concatenation value \`33\`.

### How do you detect a mobile browser

You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on 
whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.

OR

You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of 
devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is 
an alternative solution for RegExp usage,

\`\`\`javascript
function detectmob() {
 if (
   navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||
   navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
 ) {
   return true;
 } else {
   return false;
 }
}
\`\`\`

### How do you get the image width and height using JS

You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions
(width and height) using Javascript.

\`\`\`javascript
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function () {
 console.log(this.width + "x" + this.height);
};
img.src = "http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif";
\`\`\`

### How do you make synchronous HTTP request

Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to 
make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript

\`\`\`javascript
function httpGet(theUrl) {
 var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
 xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request
 xmlHttpReq.send(null);
 return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
}
\`\`\`

### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request

Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make 
asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

\`\`\`javascript
function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {
 var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
 xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
   if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
     callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
 };
 xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
 xmlHttpReq.send(null);
}
\`\`\`

### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one 
timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to 
British English timezone as below,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(event.toLocaleString("en-GB", { timeZone: "UTC" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
\`\`\`

### What are the properties used to get size of window

You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight 
properties of windows, document element and document body objects 
to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these 
properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

\`\`\`javascript
var width =
 window.innerWidth ||
 document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
 document.body.clientWidth;

var height =
 window.innerHeight ||
 document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
 document.body.clientHeight;
\`\`\`

### What are the ways to execute javascript after page load

You can execute javascript after page load in many 
different ways,

1. **window.onload:**

\`\`\`javascript
window.onload = function ...
\`\`\`

2. **document.onload:**

\`\`\`javascript
document.onload = function ...
\`\`\`

3. **body onload:**

\`\`\`javascript
<body onload="script();">
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between proto and prototype

The \`__proto__\` object is the actual object that is used in the 
lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas \`prototype\` is the 
object that is used to build \`__proto__\` when you create an 
object with new.

### What is a freeze method

The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an 
object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents 
removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, 
or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed 
object and does not create a frozen copy.

\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {
 prop: 100,
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop); //100
\`\`\`

Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in 
objects but not for nested objects.
For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment 
details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

\`\`\`javascript
const user = {
 name: "John",
 employment: {
   department: "IT",
 },
};

Object.freeze(user);
user.employment.department = "HR";
\`\`\`

**Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

### What is the purpose of freeze method

Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
2. It is used to make an object immutable.

### Why do I need to use freeze method

In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain 
elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used 
outside of their current context. Hence it works as the \`final\` 
keyword which is used in various languages.

### How do you detect a browser language preference

You can use navigator object to detect a browser language 
preference as below,

\`\`\`javascript
var language =
 (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox
 navigator.language || // All browsers
 navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

console.log(language);
\`\`\`

### How do you detect javascript disabled in the page

You can use the \`<noscript>\` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. 
The code block inside \`<noscript>\` gets executed when JavaScript is 
disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when 
the page generated in JavaScript.

\`\`\`javascript
script type="javascript">
   // JS related code goes here
script
noscript
   <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
noscript
\`\`\`

### What is a rest parameter

Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters 
which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments 
as an array. The syntax would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
 // ...
}
\`\`\`

For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic 
number of parameters,

\`\`\`javascript
function sum(...args) {
 let total = 0;
 for (const i of args) {
   total += i;
 }
 return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //10
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15
\`\`\`

**Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to 
collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, 
if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense 
and will throw an error.

\`\`\`javascript
function someFunc(a,…b,c){
//You code goes here
return;
}
\`\`\`

### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

1. Bitwise AND ( & )
2. Bitwise OR ( | )
3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
5. Left Shift ( << )
6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

### What is a spread operator

Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to 
be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example 
to see this behavior,

\`\`\`javascript
function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
 return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
\`\`\`

### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.

### How do you copy properties from one object to other

You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy 
the values and properties from one or more source objects to a 
target object. It returns the target object which has properties 
and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be 
as below,

\`\`\`javascript
Object.assign(target, ...sources);
\`\`\`

### What is a proxy object

The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental 
operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, 
function invocation, etc. 

A proxy is created with two parameters: a target object which you 
want to proxy and a handler object which contains methods to 
intercept fundamental operations. The syntax would be as follows,

\`\`\`javascript
var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
\`\`\`

### What is the purpose of seal method

The **Object.seal()** method is used to seal an object, by preventing 
new properties from being added to it and marking all existing 
properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can 
still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below 
example to understand more about seal() method

### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is 
sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's 
own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order 
as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of 
object.entries() method in an example,

\`\`\`javascript
const object = {
 a: "Good morning",
 b: 100,
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
 console.log(\`$key}: $value}\`); // a: 'Good morning'
 // b: 100
}
\`\`\`

**Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() 
method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

\`\`\`javascript
const object = {
 a: "Good morning",
 b: 100,
};

for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
 console.log(\`$value}\`); // 'Good morning \n100'
}
\`\`\`

### How can you get the list of keys of any object

You can use the \`Object.keys()\` method which is used to return an 
array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as 
we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

\`\`\`javascript
const user = {
 name: "John",
 gender: "male",
 age: 40,
};

console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
\`\`\`

### What is a WeakSet

WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) 
held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

\`\`\`javascript
new WeakSet([iterable]);
\`\`\`

### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set

The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong 
while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in 
WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
Other differences are,

1. Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
2. WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
3. WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4. WeakSet is not iterable.

### What is a WeakMap

The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be 
arbitrary values. The syntax looks like the following:

\`\`\`javascript
new WeakMap([iterable]);
\`\`\`

### What are the differences between WeakMap and Map

The main difference is that references to key objects in Map are 
strong while references to key objects in WeakMap are weak. i.e, 
A key object in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no 
other reference to it.
Other differences are,

1. Maps can store any key type Whereas WeakMaps can store only 
collections of key objects
2. WeakMap does not have size property unlike Map
3. WeakMap does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, 
entries, forEach.
4. WeakMap is not iterable.

### How do you print the contents of web page

The window object provided a print() method which is used to print 
the contents of the current window. It opens a Print dialog box 
which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's 
see the usage of print method in an example,

\`\`\`html
<input type="button" value="Print" onclick="window.print()" />
\`\`\`

**Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print 
dialog is open.

### What is an anonymous function

An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions 
are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. 
The syntax would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
function (optionalParameters) {
 //do something
}

const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
 //do something
};

[1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
 //do something
});
\`\`\`

Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

\`\`\`javascript
var x = function (a, b) {
 return a * b;
};
var z = x(5, 10);
console.log(z); // 50
\`\`\`

### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the 
same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

\`\`\`javascript
var msg = "Good morning";
function greeting() {
 msg = "Good Evening";
 console.log(msg); // Good Evening
}
greeting();
\`\`\`

### What are javascript accessors

ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed 
properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the \`get\` 
keyword whereas Setters uses the \`set\` keyword.

\`\`\`javascript
var user = {
 firstName: "John",
 lastName: "Abraham",
 language: "en",
 get lang() {
   return this.language;
 },
 set lang(lang) {
   this.language = lang;
 },
};
console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
user.lang = "fr";
console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
\`\`\`

### What are primitive data types

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has 
no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. bigint
7. symbol

### What are the various statements in error handling

Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

### What are the two types of loops in javascript

1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test 
condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For 
Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test 
condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, 
the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test 
condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under 
this category.

### What is nodejs

Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript 
runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. 
It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that 
uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

### What is an event loop

The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call 
stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack 
is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in 
the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event 
queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the 
event, and any additional events generated during the execution 
are added to the end of the event queue.

**Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking 
I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by 
offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. 
Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle 
multiple operations executing in the background.

### What is call stack

Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep 
track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. 
It has two major actions,

1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing 
it to the stack.
2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped 
out of the stack.

### What is a decorator

A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that 
takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. 
Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on 
the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class 
at design time,

\`\`\`javascript
function admin(isAdmin) {
  return function(target) {
      target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
  }
}

@admin(true)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

@admin(false)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
\`\`\`

### What is an Unary operator

The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.
If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number 
but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

\`\`\`javascript
var x = "100";
var y = +x;
console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

var a = "Hello";
var b = +a;
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
\`\`\`

### How do you sort elements in an array

The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place 
and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, 
based on the string Unicode order. The example usage would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
months.sort();
console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
\`\`\`

### How do you reversing an array

You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. 
This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see 
the usage of reverse() method in an example,

\`\`\`javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
\`\`\`

### How do you find min and max value in an array

You can use \`Math.min\` and \`Math.max\` methods on array variables 
to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. 
Let's create two functions to find the min and max value 
with in an array,

\`\`\`javascript
var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
 return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
}
function findMax(arr) {
 return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));
\`\`\`

### What is a comma operator

The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to 
right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different 
from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and 
parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as 
below,

\`\`\`javascript
var x = 1;
x = (x++, x);

console.log(x); // 2
\`\`\`

### What is a constructor method

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing 
an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor 
method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor 
would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
class Employee {
 constructor() {
   this.name = "John";
 }
}

var employeeObject = new Employee();

console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
\`\`\`

### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class

The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined 
only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once 
in a class it will throw a \`SyntaxError\` error.

### What is MEAN in javascript

The MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack is the most popular 
open-source JavaScript software tech stack available for building dynamic web 
apps where you can write both the server-side and client-side halves of the 
web project entirely in JavaScript.

### What Is Obfuscation in javascript

Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code
(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. 
It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the 
code and execute it.
Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

\`\`\`javascript
function greeting() {
 console.log("Hello, welcome to JS world");
}
\`\`\`

And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

\`\`\`javascript
eval(
 (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {
   e = function (c) {
     return c;
   };
   if (!"".replace(/^/, String)) {
     while (c--) {
       d[c] = k[c] || c;
     }
     k = [
       function (e) {
         return d[e];
       },
     ];
     e = function () {
       return "\\w+";
     };
     c = 1;
   }
   while (c--) {
     if (k[c]) {
       p = p.replace(new RegExp("\\b" + e(c) + "\\b", "g"), k[c]);
     }
   }
   return p;
 })(
   "2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}",
   9,
   9,
   "console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world".split("|"),
   0,
   {}
 )
);
\`\`\`

### Why do you need Obfuscation

Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,

1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and 
client will be fast.
2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code 
from others
3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult
4. The download time will be reduced

### What is Minification

Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters
(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without 
changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation.

### What are the advantages of minification

Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,

1. Decreases loading times of a web page
2. Saves bandwidth usages

### What are the differences between Obfuscation and Encryption

Below are the main differences between Obfuscation and Encryption,

| Feature            | Obfuscation                                     | Encryption                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition         | Changing the form of any data in any other form | Changing the form of information to an unreadable format by using a key |
| A key to decode    | It can be decoded without any key               | It is required                                                          |
| Target data format | It will be converted to a complex form          | Converted into an unreadable format                                     |

### Is enums feature available in javascript

No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds 
of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. 
For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,

\`\`\`javascript
var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
\`\`\`

### What is an enum

An enum is a type restricting variables to one value from a predefined 
set of constants. JavaScript has no enums but typescript provides built-in 
enum support.

\`\`\`javascript
enum Color {
RED, GREEN, BLUE
}
\`\`\`

### How do you list all properties of an object

You can use the \`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()\` method which returns an 
array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's see the 
usage of this in an example below:

\`\`\`javascript
const newObject = {
 a: 1,
 b: 2,
 c: 3,
};

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));
["a", "b", "c"];
\`\`\`

### How do I modify the url without reloading the page

The \`window.location.href\` property will be helpful to modify the 
url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the \`history.pushState()\` and \`history.replaceState()\` methods, which allow you to add and modify 
history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

\`\`\`javascript
window.history.pushState("page2", "Title", "/page2.html");
\`\`\`

### How do you check whether an array includes a particular value or not

The \`Array#includes()\` method is used to determine whether an array 
includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true 
or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) 
within an array.

\`\`\`javascript
var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true

var stringArray = ["green", "yellow", "blue"];
console.log(stringArray.includes("blue")); //true
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between java and javascript

Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation 
between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. 
Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a 
browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in 
a tabular format,
| Feature | Java | JavaScript |
|---- | ---- | -----
| Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
| Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |
| Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped |
| Concurrency | Thread based | event based |
| Memory | Uses more memory | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

### How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically

You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as 
child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style 
resources as below,

\`\`\`javascript
function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {
 if (filetype == "css") {
   // External CSS file
   var fileReference = document.createElement("link");
   fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
   fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
   fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
 } else if (filetype == "js") {
   // External JavaScript file
   var fileReference = document.createElement("script");
   fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
   fileReference.setAttribute("src", filename);
 }
 if (typeof fileReference != "undefined")
   document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileReference);
}
\`\`\`

### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start 
with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below 
methods to find the HTML element,

1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

### What is jQuery

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document 
Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions 
by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with 
its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display 
welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

\`\`\`javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
 // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
 alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
});
\`\`\`

**Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install 
it from CDNs, like google.

### What is V8 JavaScript engine

V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google 
Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. 
It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, 
macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
**Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in 
JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, 
and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

\`\`\`javascript
let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = "old"; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean
\`\`\`

### What is a void operator

The \`void\` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns 
undefined(i.e, without returning value).

### How to set the cursor to wait

The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property "cursor". 
Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.

\`\`\`javascript
function myFunction() {
 window.document.body.style.cursor = "wait";
}
\`\`\`

and this function invoked on page load

\`\`\`html
<body onload="myFunction()"></body>
\`\`\`

### What is the output of the following for loops

\`\`\`javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
 // global scope
 setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
 // block scope
 setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}
\`\`\`

The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

**Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the \`setTimeout\` 
callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the 
variable i is declared with the \`var\` keyword it became a global 
variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time 
\`setTimeout\` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second 
loop is \`4 4 4 4\`.

Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the \`let\` 
keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value
(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop 
is \`0 1 2 3\`.

### List down some of the features of ES6

Below are the list of some new features of ES6,

1. Support for constants or immutable variables
2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions
3. Arrow functions
4. Default parameters
5. Rest and Spread Parameters
6. Template Literals
7. Multi-line Strings
8. Destructuring Assignment
9. Enhanced Object Literals
10. Promises
11. Classes
12. Modules

### What is ES6

ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released 
in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed 
to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the 
old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

### Can I redeclare let and const variables

No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws 
below error

### Does the \`const\` variable make the value immutable

No, the \`const\` variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it 
disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment 
but can't assign another value later)

\`\`\`javascript
const userList = [];
userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
console.log(userList); // ['John']
\`\`\`

### What are template literals

Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing 
embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (\`) 
character instead of double or single quotes.
In ES6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

\`\`\`javascript
var greeting = \`Welcome to JS World, Mr. $firstName} $lastName}.\`;
\`\`\`

In ES5, you need break string like below,

\`\`\`javascript
var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.\`
\`\`\`

**Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation 
features with template literals.

### What are raw strings

ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the \`String.raw()\` method which 
is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature 
allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without 
processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
var calculationString = String.raw\`The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4
      }!\`;
console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is \n10!
\`\`\`

If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will 
be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

\`\`\`javascript
var calculationString = \`The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!\`;
console.log(calculationString);
// The sum of numbers is
// 10!
\`\`\`

Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag 
function

\`\`\`javascript
function tag(strings) {
 console.log(strings.raw[0]);
}
\`\`\`

### What is destructuring assignment

The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it 
possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into 
distinct variables.
Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

\`\`\`javascript
var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

console.log(one); // "JAN"
console.log(two); // "FEB"
console.log(three); // "MARCH"
\`\`\`

and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

\`\`\`javascript
var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 32
\`\`\`

### What are default values in destructuring assignment

A variable can be assigned a default value when the value 
unpacked from the array or object is undefined during 
destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default 
values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example 
for both arrays and object use cases,

**Arrays destructuring:**

\`\`\`javascript
var x, y, z;

[x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
\`\`\`

**Objects destructuring:**

\`\`\`javascript
var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
\`\`\`

### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values 
requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, 
two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. 
Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

\`\`\`javascript
var x = 10,
 y = 20;

[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x); // 20
console.log(y); // 10
\`\`\`

### What are dynamic imports

The dynamic imports using \`import()\` function syntax allows us to load 
modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently 
this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). 
The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, 
the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the 
user experience.
The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
\`\`\`

### What is for...of statement

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or 
elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments 
or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic 
usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for (let value of arrayIterable) {
 value++;
 console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
}
\`\`\`

### What is the output of below spread operator array

\`\`\`javascript
[..."John Resig"];
\`\`\`

The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']

**Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator 
within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. 
Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

### Is PostMessage secure

Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the 
programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and 
source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a 
message without verifying its source will create cross-site 
scripting attacks.

### Can I avoid using postMessages completely

You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though 
your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot 
of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third 
party service. So your application might be using postMessage 
without your knowledge.

### Is postMessages synchronous

The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are 
asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, 
Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a 
callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

### What paradigm is Javascript

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural 
programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. 
JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.

### Is JavaScript faster than server side script

Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript 
is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for 
its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than 
any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

### Do all objects have prototypes

No. All objects have prototypes except the base object or an object 
created with Object.create(null) method. The base object is Object.prototype, 
and its prototype is null.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument

Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument 
represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's 
explain this with a simple function

\`\`\`javascript
function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
 console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
 console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
 console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
}
myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");
\`\`\`

### How do you combine two or more arrays

The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning 
a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
\`\`\`

### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy

There are two ways to copy an object,

**Shallow Copy:**
Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created 
that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any 
of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just 
the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address 
is copied.

**Example**

\`\`\`javascript
var empDetails = {
 name: "John",
 age: 25,
 expertise: "Software Developer",
};
\`\`\`

to create a duplicate

\`\`\`javascript
var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
\`\`\`

if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

\`\`\`javascript
empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
\`\`\`

The above statement will also change the name of \`empDetails\`, 
since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original 
data as well.

**Deep copy:**
A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically 
allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs 
when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

**Example**

\`\`\`javascript
var empDetails = {
 name: "John",
 age: 25,
 expertise: "Software Developer",
};
\`\`\`

Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object 
into new variable

\`\`\`javascript
var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
 name: empDetails.name,
 age: empDetails.age,
 expertise: empDetails.expertise,
};
\`\`\`

Now if you change \`empDetailsDeepCopy.name\`, it will only affect 
\`empDetailsDeepCopy\` & not \`empDetails\`

### How do you create specific number of copies of a string

The \`repeat()\` method is used to construct and return a new string 
which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which 
it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method 
has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

\`\`\`javascript
"Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
\`\`\`

(CODE) ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator

Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(+"Hello"); // NaN
\`\`\`

The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because 
the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript 
interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. 
Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in 
NaN value.

### Does javascript uses mixins

Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing 
methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from 
it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can 
be only one \`[[prototype]]\` for an object.

But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we 
can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another 
class.

Say for instance, we've two classes \`User\` and \`CleanRoom\`. Suppose we 
need to add \`CleanRoom\` functionality to \`User\`, so that user can clean 
the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.

\`\`\`javascript
// mixin
let cleanRoomMixin = {
 cleanRoom() {
   alert(\`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now\`);
 },
 sayBye() {
   alert(\`Bye ${this.name}\`);
 },
};

// usage:
class User {
 constructor(name) {
   this.name = name;
 }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

// now User can clean the room
new User("Dude").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!
\`\`\`

### What is a thunk function

A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. 
It doesn't take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke 
the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime 
in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

\`\`\`javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

thunk(); // 5
\`\`\`

### What are asynchronous thunks

The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. 
Let's see an example of network requests,

\`\`\`javascript
function fetchData(fn) {
 fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
   .then((response) => response.json())
   .then((json) => fn(json));
}

const asyncThunk = function () {
 return fetchData(function getData(data) {
   console.log(data);
 });
};

asyncThunk();
\`\`\`

The \`getData\` function won't be called immediately but it will be 
invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The 
setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. 
The best real time example is redux state management library which 
uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

(CODE) ### What is the output of below function calls

**Code snippet:**

\`\`\`javascript
const circle = {
 radius: 20,
 diameter() {
   return this.radius * 2;
 },
 perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(circle.diameter());
console.log(circle.perimeter());
\`\`\`

**Output:**

The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, 
whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The \`this\` keyword 
of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope 
which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter 
function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. 
Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an 
undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

(CODE) ### What happens with negating an array

Negating an array with \`!\` character will coerce the array into a boolean. 
Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return \`false\`.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(![]); // false
\`\`\`

(CODE) ### What happens if we add two arrays

If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and 
concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(["a"] + ["b"]); // "ab"
console.log([] + []); // ""
console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
\`\`\`

(CODE) ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values

If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, 
undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number 
value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(+null); // 0
console.log(+undefined); // NaN
console.log(+false); // 0
console.log(+NaN); // NaN
console.log(+""); // 0
\`\`\`

### How do you remove falsy values from an array

You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a 
parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, 
false and "") from the array.

\`\`\`javascript
const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];
myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
\`\`\`

### How do you get unique values of an array

You can get unique values of an array with the combination of \`Set\` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
\`\`\`

### What is destructuring aliases

Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a 
different name than the property name. In that case, you'll 
use a \`: newName\` to specify a name for the variable. This process 
is called destructuring aliases.

\`\`\`javascript
const obj = { x: 1 };
// Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
const { x: otherName } = obj;
\`\`\`

### How do you empty an array

You can empty an array quickly by setting the array length to zero.

\`\`\`javascript
let cities = ["Singapore", "Delhi", "London"];
cities.length = 0; // cities becomes []
\`\`\`

### How do you round numbers to certain decimals

You can round numbers to a certain number of decimals using 
\`toFixed\` method from native javascript.

\`\`\`javascript
let pie = 3.141592653;
pie = pie.toFixed(3); // 3.142
\`\`\`

### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

You can convert an array to an object with the same data using 
spread(...) operator.

\`\`\`javascript
var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };
console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}
\`\`\`

### How do you create an array with some data

You can create an array with some data or an array with the same 
values using \`fill\` method.

\`\`\`javascript
var newArray = new Array(5).fill("0");
console.log(newArray); // ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0"]
\`\`\`

### How do you verify that an argument is a Number or not

The combination of IsNaN and isFinite methods are used to confirm 
whether an argument is a number or not.

\`\`\`javascript
function isNumber(n) {
 return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);
}
\`\`\`

### What is the shortcut to get timestamp

You can use \`new Date().getTime()\` to get the current timestamp. 
There is an alternative shortcut to get the value.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log(+new Date());
console.log(Date.now());
\`\`\`

### What is the easiest multi condition checking

You can use \`indexOf\` to compare input with multiple values instead of 
checking each value as one condition.

\`\`\`javascript
// Verbose approach
if (
 input === "first" ||
 input === 1 ||
 input === "second" ||
 input === 2
) {
 someFunction();
}
// Shortcut
if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
 someFunction();
}
\`\`\`

### How do you capture browser back button

The \`beforeunload\` event is triggered when the window, the document 
and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to 
warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.

\`\`\`javascript
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  console.log('Clicked browser back button');
});
\`\`\`

You can also use \`popstate\` event to detect the browser back button. 
**Note:** The history entry has been activated using \`history.pushState\` 
method.

\`\`\`javascript
window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
  console.log('Clicked browser back button');
  box.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
});

const box = document.getElementById('div');

box.addEventListener('click', () => {
box.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
window.history.pushState({}, null, null);
});
\`\`\`

In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background 
color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking 
the browser back button using \`popstate\` event handler. The \`state\` 
property of \`popstate\` contains the copy of history entry's state object.

### What is AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a 
group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest 
API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to 
the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

### What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code

Below are the list of different ways to deal with Asynchronous code.

1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async/await
4. Third-party libraries such as async.js,bluebird etc

### What is web speech API

Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and 
synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was 
introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012.

### What are tasks in event loop

A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run 
by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, 
run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these 
tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or 
running by the \`script\` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback 
added to task queue

### What are different event loops

In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending 
on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:

1. The Browser Event Loop
2. The Node.js Event Loop


- Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP 
requests, and other asynchronous actions.

- The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications 
and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js 
runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.

### What are the differences between promises and observables

Some of the major difference in a tabular form

| Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
| Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |
| Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |
| Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |
| Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |

### What is heap

Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored 
when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory 
allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are 
two containers of JS runtime.
Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the 
code it stores them in the Heap.

### What is the difference between shim and polyfill

A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, 
using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily 
restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used 
to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the 
technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide 
natively.
In a simple sentence, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

### What is babel

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a 
backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers 
or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

1. Transform syntax
2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment 
(using @babel/polyfill)
3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

### Is Node.js completely single threaded

Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js 
standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, 
Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed 
and performance of a program.

### What is an async function

An async function is a function declared with the \`async\` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style 
by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more 
\`await\` expressions.

Let's take a below async function example,

\`\`\`javascript
async function logger() {
 let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
 console.log(data);
}
logger();
\`\`\`

It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

### What is deno

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and 
TypeScript that uses V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming 
language. It solves the inherent problems of Node.Js and has been 
officially released in May 2018. Unlike Node.JS, by default Deno  
executes the code in a sandbox, which means that runtime has no access 
to below areas:

1. The file system
2. The network
3. Execution of other scripts
4. The environment variables

### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas 
Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded 
into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the 
spread operator.

### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. 
The only difference is over what they iterate:

1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

### What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?

It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand 
when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise 
returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the 
logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand 
if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.

\`\`\`js
console.log(null ?? true); // true
console.log(false ?? true); // false
console.log(undefined ?? true); // true
\`\`\`

### What is debouncing?

Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some 
piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles and 
API calls_. This in turn enhance the web page performance. The debounce 
function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. 
The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, 
and eliminating double-button clicks.

### What is throttling?

Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler 
function in a given period of time, even when this event triggers continuously 
due to user actions. The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling, 
mouse movements etc.

### What is optional chaining?

According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits 
reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected 
objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the 
chain is valid.

The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of 
causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the 
expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used 
with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does 
not exist.

\`\`\`js
const adventurer = {
 name: "Alice",
 cat: {
   name: "Dinah",
 },
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName);
// expected output: undefined

console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());
// expected output: undefined
\`\`\`

### What is pass by value and pass by reference?

Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of 
a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will 
actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't 
impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each 
other.

\`\`\`javascript
let a = 5;
let b = a;

b++;
console.log(a, b); //5, 6
\`\`\`

In the above code snippet, the value of \`a\` is assigned to \`b\` and 
the variable \`b\` has been incremented. Since there is a new space 
created for variable \`b\`, any update on this variable doesn't impact 
the variable \`a\`.

Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new 
variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives 
such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable 
variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.

\`\`\`javascript
let user1 = {
 name: "John",
 age: 27,
};
let user2 = user1;
user2.age = 30;

console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30
\`\`\`

In the above code snippet, updating the \`age\` property of one object 
will impact the other property due to the same reference.

### What are the differences between primitives and non-primitives?

JavaScript language has both primitives and non-primitives but there 
are few differences between them as below,

| Primitives                 | Non-primitives       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| These types are predefined | Created by developer |
| These are immutable        | Mutable              |
| Compare by value           | Compare by reference |
| Stored in Stack            | Stored in heap       |
| Contain certain value      | Can contain NULL too |

### How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?

Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async 
function resulted in a SyntaxError.

\`\`\`javascript
await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function
\`\`\`

But you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately 
Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the feature.

\`\`\`javascript
(async function () {
 await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // Hello await
})();
\`\`\`

In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.

await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); //Hello await

### What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
* The \`this\` keyword in JavaScript is a special variable that is used within a function to refer to the object on which the function is invoked. The value of this depends on how the function is called. It allows functions to access and interact with the object they are bound to.
* The this keyword in JavaScript is a reference to the object that owns or invokes the current function. Its value is determined by the calling context.

  **Example 1: this in a Global Context**
  \`\`\`javascript
  console.log(this);
  \`\`\`
  * In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).

  **Example 2: this in a Function**
  \`\`\`javascript
  function displayThis() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  displayThis();
  \`\`\`
  *  In a regular function, this refers to the global object.

  **Example 3: this in a Method**
  \`\`\`javascript
  const person = {
    name: 'John',
    greet: function() {
      console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
    }
  };

  person.greet();
  \`\`\`
  * In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).

  **Example 4: this in an Event Handler**
  \`\`\`javascript
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log(this);
  });
  \`\`\`
  *  In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).

### What are the possible reasons for memory leaks?
Memory leaks can lead to poor performance, slow loading times and even 
crashes in web applications. Some of the common causes of memory leaks are listed below,

1. The execessive usage of global variables or omitting the \`var\` keyword 
in local scope.
2. Forgetting to clear the timers set up by \`setTimeout\` or \`setInterval\`.
3. Closures retain references to variables from their parent scope, 
which leads to variables might not garbage collected even they are no longer used.

### What are the event phases of a browser?
There are 3 phases in the lifecycle of an event propagation in JavaScript,

1. **Capturing phase:** This phase goes down gradually from the top of the 
DOM tree to the target element when a nested element clicked. Before the 
click event reaching the final destination element, the click event of 
each parent's element must be triggered.

2. **Target phase:** This is the phase where the event originally occurred 
reached the target element .

3. **Bubbling phase:** This is reverse of the capturing phase. In this pase, 
the event bubbles up from the target element through it's parent element, an 
ancestor and goes all the way to the global window object.
